# Rescue Station Manager

The Rescue Station Manager is responsible for signing in and off rescue station,
as well as updating. It handles incoming requests and manages the process by
communication with the Protocol and Deployment domain (where the actual Rescue
Stations and most of the logic live).

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test api-rescue-station-manager` to execute the unit tests via
[Jest](https://jestjs.io).
